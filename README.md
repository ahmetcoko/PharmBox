# Future Enhancements

Redesigning the User Interface: We plan to overhaul the general design of PharmBox to provide a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. The new design will focus on ease of navigation and accessibility, ensuring that all users can efficiently manage their health information.

Individual Drug Windows: To enhance information accessibility and organization, we will implement dedicated windows for each medication. This feature will allow users to view detailed information, reviews, and posts specific to a drug in a single, centralized location, making it easier to access and digest important data.
